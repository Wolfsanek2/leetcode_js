// We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

// I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked (the number I picked stays the same throughout the game).

// Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

// You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

// -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
// 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
// 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
// Return the number that I picked.
